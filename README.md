# VBA-Challenge

Stock Analysis using VBA
** The repository stores the Module 2 VBA Challenge ** 

# Overview of Project
Steve wants to do a little more research for his parents, he wants to expand the existing green_stocks dataset to include the entire stock market over the last few years. Although the code works well for a dozen stocks, it might not work as well for thousands of stocks. And if it does, it may take a long time to execute. Steve wants to make the solution code much simpler and run faster.

# Purpose
In this challenge, we'll edit, or refactor, the Module 2 solution code to loop through all the data one time in order to collect the same information that we did in this module. Then, we have to  determine whether refactoring our code successfully made the VBA script run faster. Refactoring means: you are trying to make the code more efficient by taking fewer steps, using less memory, or improving the logic of the code to make it easier for future users to read.

None

Module 2 from Boot Camp

# Results

By reviewing the images from refactored code (VBA_Challenge) and original code (Green_stocks) i find that it is identical though using refactoring clearly as teh timer data suggests there is more efficiency in running the sub-routine.

# Summary

1. What are teh advantages or disadavcntages of refactoring code?

Advantages:

i. When refactoring code, you are not adding new functionality; you just want to make the code
more efficient by taking fewer steps, using less memory, or improving the logic of the code to make it easier for future users to read.

ii. Refactoring is common on the job because first attempts at code won't always be the best way to accomplish a task.

Disadvantages:

i. When refactoring code, you may need to spend extra time to make it work exactly like the original code.

ii. High chance of errors, if not done diligently.

2. There is a detailed statement on the advantages and disadvantages of the original and refactored VBA script (3 pt).

i. It was not easy to follow along the instruction for this challenge, which makes me think if one has refactor someone else's code it will take time.
ii. Fewer errors compared to me writing the entire code initially.
